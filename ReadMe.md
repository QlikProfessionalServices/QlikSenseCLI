A new version of the module will be release with each major release of Qlik Sense Enterprise containing all of the changes in the OpenAPI specification. 

The Version number of the QlikSenseCLI will relate to the Version of the OpenAPI schema in Qlik Sense.

Each release comes in two variants.
net45 & netstandard2.0

the net45 can be used by Windows PowerShell 4+ 
the netstandard2.0 can be used by PowerShell 5 and PowerShell 7+ (on Windows/MacOSx/Linux)
